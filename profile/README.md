# Marvel Rival Aimbot Pro Tool üéØ

Built for players who want surgical accuracy and repeatable aiming performance, **Marvel Rival Aimbot Pro** is an overlay-driven utility that provides configurable aim smoothing, FOV targeting, and recoil compensation ‚Äî all accessible via an in-game overlay and hotkeys. Use it to test reaction windows, practice tracking, and prototype aiming configs in private play.


---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Marvel Rival Aimbot Pro is designed as a testing and practice utility, not a competitive shortcut. It runs an overlay with modular features so you can:

* Define a target FOV (field-of-view) where aim assistance activates.
* Use smooth interpolation to keep aim natural and consistent.
* Apply optional recoil compensation and target prioritization.
* Map features to hotkeys and save multiple profiles for different heroes.

This tool emphasizes configurability and subtlety ‚Äî build setups for tracking heroes, snap aiming, or experimenting with sensitivity and aim curves.

## üß© Key Features

* **FOV Targeting** ‚Äî Set a circular FOV; aim assist only engages inside that zone.
* **Smooth Aim / Interpolation** ‚Äî Adjustable smoothing (0‚Äì100) for natural, human-like corrections.
* **Recoil Compensation** ‚Äî Compensate predictable weapon recoil so reticle returns to target faster.
* **Target Prioritization** ‚Äî Prioritize nearest, lowest-health, or visible-only targets.
* **Aim Key & Toggle Modes** ‚Äî Hold-to-aim, toggle, or hold + snap modes.
* **Profile System** ‚Äî Save hero-specific configs (sensitivity, FOV, smoothing).
* **Overlay & Hotkeys** ‚Äî In-game overlay, transparent HUD, and fully remappable hotkeys.

[!NOTE]
This utility is intended for **offline testing, private lobbies, and practice modes only**. Do not use in ranked or public multiplayer matches ‚Äî respect fair play and platform rules.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (‚ö°Ô∏è)

1. Download and extract the archive to a folder you control.
2. Launch **Marvel Rival** in a private lobby or practice mode.
3. Run `rival_aimbot_pro.exe` as Administrator.
4. Press your configured hotkey (default `F1`) to open the overlay and load a profile.
5. Tighten FOV, lower smoothing for snap aim, or increase it for tracking practice.

```bash
# Example quick run (Windows)
rival_aimbot_pro.exe --overlay --profile "Tracer_Practice"
```

## üîí Safety & Responsible Use

[!WARNING]
This tool is provided for **personal training and experimentation** only. Using aim assistance in public or competitive matches violates most games‚Äô terms of service and can result in account bans. Use responsibly: private lobbies, offline practice, and learning purposes only.

---

## üõ† Advanced Settings (examples)

* FOV Radius: `80 px` ‚Äî sets detection circle.
* Smooth: `40%` ‚Äî moderate smoothing for natural aim.
* Snap Strength: `0.6` ‚Äî for quick correction snaps.
* Recoil Comp: `adaptive` ‚Äî uses observed recoil pattern to correct vertical drift.
* Target Filter: `visible && lowest_health` ‚Äî picks visible, low-health targets.

Pro tip: Start with conservative values (high smoothing, large FOV) while learning, then refine for tighter tracking.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will this get me banned?**
A: Using aim assistance in public/competitive matches can lead to bans. Always test in private lobbies and follow the game's ToS.

**Q: Is this compatible with all heroes?**
A: Yes ‚Äî use the profile system to tune settings per hero and weapon behavior.

**Q: Can I remap hotkeys and UI scale?**
A: Fully remappable hotkeys and overlay scaling are supported in Settings ‚Üí Controls.

**Q: What if the game updates and the overlay fails?**
A: We provide regular compatibility updates; check the changelog and update your tool when patches land.

**Q: Is there a learning mode?**
A: Yes ‚Äî training scenarios, bot targets, and visual telemetry (aim path, deviation) are included.

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

* Overlay not showing: Run the tool as Administrator and disable fullscreen optimizations for the game.
* Targets not detected: Ensure line-of-sight mode is enabled and the correct capture method is chosen (memory vs. visual).
* High CPU usage: Lower telemetry logging and enable GPU-assisted rendering if available.
